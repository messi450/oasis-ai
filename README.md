# Oasis Project

This repository contains the source code for the Oasis project, organized into a monorepo-style structure to support future backend and AI integration.

## Project Structure

- **frontend/**: The React client application. Contains the UI, internal API clients, and feature logic.
- **backend/**: The server-side application (formerly planned). Dedicated space for Python/Node.js backend and AI model integration.
- **shared/**: Shared resources, types, or constants between frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
The frontend application has been moved to the `frontend/` directory.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
The backend infrastructure is initialized in `backend/`. 
(Add specific setup instructions here once implemented)
